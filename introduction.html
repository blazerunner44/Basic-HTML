	<h1>About My Work</h1>
	<p>In May 2020, I started a custom web application company with my wife called Maiden Voyage Software. We've had a lot of fun building up that company. We currently have 5 student developers working with us to create amazing applications for our clients. Our work ranges from dental lab management software to a commercial property listing service. You can learn more about our company at <a href="https://yourmaidenvoyage.com">yourmaidenvoyage.com</a></p>
